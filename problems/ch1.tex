        We prove by construct a chain of iffs.
        \begin{IEEEeqnarray*}{C'rCl}
            & (b - a)^2 & = & c^2 - 2ab \\
            \Leftrightarrow & a^2 + b^2 - 2ab & = & c^2 - 2ab \\
            \Leftrightarrow & a^2 + b^2 & = & c^2 \\
        \end{IEEEeqnarray*}

        \item The equation would still hold true since $a = b$ is not
        a requirement for the proof. In fact, note that if $a = b$,
        the area of the bigger square in \ref{1.a.sec1} will now be
        exactly equal to the sum of area of all triangles inside it,
        which is equal to the sum of area of two smaller squares in \ref{1.b.sec1}.
        That is, $c^2 = a^2 + b^2$.

        \item Some assumptions about right triangles, squares and lines are,
        \begin{itemize}
            \item 4 identical right triangles.
            \item For every 2 points, there is a line.

        \item Mistake:
        \begin{equation*}
            \sqrt{(-1)(-1)} = \sqrt{-1}\sqrt{-1}
        \end{equation*}
        The right-hand side of this equation is undefined while the left-hand side
        is defined.
        \item Suppose $1 = -1$, then
        \begin{IEEEeqnarray*}{C'rCl}
                        & 0     & = & 0 \\
            \Rightarrow & 1^2 - 1^2 & = & 1 + 1 \\
            \Rightarrow & (1 - 1)(1 + 1) & = & 1 + 1
        \end{IEEEeqnarray*}
        At this stage, we cancel off $1 + 1$ on each side since they are non-zero, the equation
        then becomes,
        \begin{IEEEeqnarray*}{C'rCl}
            \Rightarrow & 1 - 1 & = & 1 \\
            \Rightarrow & 1 + 1 & = & 1 \\
            \Rightarrow & 2 & = & 1
        \end{IEEEeqnarray*}
        where the second equation is by the antecedent $1 = -1$. Hence, we have
        proved $2 = 1$.
        \item We shall prove the following lemma,
        \begin{lemPr}
            If $r,s > 0$, then $\sqrt{rs} = \sqrt{r}\sqrt{s}$
        \end{lemPr}
        \begin{proof}
            Assume $r,s > 0$. For every positive integer $x$, there is one $\sqrt{x} > 0$
            such that $x = (\sqrt{x})^2$; therefore,
            \begin{equation}
                (\sqrt{r})^2(\sqrt{s})^2 = rs
            \end{equation}
            By commutative and associative property of multiplication, 
            \begin{equation}
                (\sqrt{r})^2(\sqrt{s})^2 = (\sqrt{r}\sqrt{s})^2
            \end{equation}
            which leads to
            \begin{equation}
                (\sqrt{r}\sqrt{s})^2 = rs
            \end{equation}
            Since $rs > 0$, there is also one $\sqrt{rs} > 0$ such that
            $(\sqrt{rs})^2 = rs$. Therefore,
            \begin{equation}
                (\sqrt{r}\sqrt{s})^2 = (\sqrt{rs})^2
            \end{equation}
            Since $\sqrt{r}\sqrt{s} > 0$ and $\sqrt{rs} > 0$,
            we conclude
            \begin{equation}
                \sqrt{r}\sqrt{s} = \sqrt{rs}
            \end{equation}
        \end{proof}

        \item Mistake,
        \begin{IEEEeqnarray*}{rCl}
            3                & > & 2 \\
            3\log_{10} (1/2) & > & 2\log_{10} (1/2)
        \end{IEEEeqnarray*}
        since $\log_{10} n \;\forall  0 < n < 1$ is always negative.
        \item Wrong because all arithmetic operations must be done
        on numbers with the same currency, so that they will be in the
        same field.
        \item Since $a = b$, $a - b = 0$, and therefore we cannot
        cancel $a - b$ on both sides since we cannot divide each side by $0$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{pr}

\begin{pr}
    The questionable step is from step 2 to step 3, namely,
    \begin{IEEEeqnarray*}{rCl}
        a + b & \overset{?}{\geq} & 2\sqrt{ab}Â \\
        a^2 + 2ab + b^2 & \overset{?}{\geq} & 4ab
    \end{IEEEeqnarray*}

    Assume that $a, b < 0$. Then even though the first inequality
    is false, the second inequality is true, which will lead to all
    subsequent inequalities to be true. Therefore, we have just ``proved''
    that arithmetic mean is at least as large as geometric mean for
    all negative numbers $a, b$!

    To fix this,
    \begin{IEEEeqnarray*}{rCl}
        \dfrac{a + b}{2} & \geq & \sqrt{ab} \\
        a + b - 2\sqrt{ab} & \geq & 0 \\
        (\sqrt{a} - \sqrt{b})^2 & \geq & 0 \\
    \end{IEEEeqnarray*}

    This ensures that $a, b \geq 0$ so that the last inequality
    can be defined.

    The reasoning is wrong because of the implicit assumption
    on Monday.

    \begin{assPr} \label{assPr:1.5:sec1}
        If Albert didn't give the quiz \boldText{before} Monday,
        by Midnight Sunday, we know the quiz has to be on Monday.
    \end{assPr}

    The contrapositive of this statement is,

    \begin{assPr}[equivalent to \ref{assPr:1.5:sec1}]
        If the quiz is not on Monday, then Albert gave the quiz
        \boldText{before} Monday.
    \end{assPr}

    This is a false assumption since we know Albert gives out
    his quiz on next week. This collapses the chain of arguments
    and therefore the reasoning is false.

    We prove by case analysis. Let $x = \log_{7} n \;\forall n \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$
    so that $7^x = n$.
    We argue that there are two scenarios,
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $x$ is an integer
        \item $x$ is a non-integer
    \end{enumerate}
    These cases are clearly exhaustive.
    \begin{casesp}
        \item $x$ is an integer
        
        We use a certain fact called the fundamental theorem of algebra,

        \begin{factPr} \label{fact1:sec1.6:ch1}
            All positive integers are products of unique primes.
        \end{factPr}

        Therefore, for all $n$ that are a product of $7s$ (e.g, $7$, $7^2$, $7^3$, \ldots),
        $x$ is an integer.
        
        \item $x$ is a non-integer
        
        We prove by contradiction. Assume $x$ is rational, then $x = \dfrac{p}{q}$
        for all integers $p,q \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$ that do not share common factor such that $7^{\frac{p}{q}} = n$.
        Then $n^q = 7^p$. By fact \ref{fact1:sec1.6:ch1}, $n = 7^k$ for some positive integer $k$,
        which means $7^{qk} = 7^p$. Then $\dfrac{p}{q} = k$, which contradicts the fact $p$
        and $q$ do not share a common factor. We conclude that $x$ is irrational.

    We claim that,

    \begin{claimPr}
        An irrational number powered to an irrational number can be rational.
    \end{claimPr}

    We prove by case analysis. Let's consider $\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}$ to be one of the two cases,

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}$ is rational
        \item $\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}$ is irrational
    \end{enumerate}

    In case 1, we have the conclusion. In case 2, suppose $x = \sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}$
    and $y = \sqrt{2}$, then

    \begin{equation*}
        x^y = \sqrt{2}^{(\sqrt{2})^2} = (\sqrt{2})^2 = 2
    \end{equation*}

    Therefore, we conclude that an irrational number powered to an irrational number
    can be rational.

    We prove $|r + s| \leq |r| + |s| \;\forall r,s \in \mathbb{R}$ by case analysis.
    \begin{casesp}
        \item $r > 0$, $s > 0$

            (r + s) = r + s

        \begin{equation*}
            |r + s| \leq r - s
        \end{equation*}
        There are two subcases in this one,
        \begin{casesp}
            \item $r + s \geq 0$
            \begin{equation*}
                r + s < r - s
            \end{equation*}
            \item $r + s < 0$
            \begin{equation*}
                -r - s < r - s
            \end{equation*}
        \end{casesp}
        \item $r < 0$, $s > 0$

        Very similar to the case above, interchange the role of $r, s$.
        
        \item $r < 0$, $s < 0$
        
        Then $-(r + s) = -r - s = (-r) + (-s)$.

        \item We prove by case analysis. Without loss of generality, assume $z = a + b$
        and $d = z + c$ where $a,b,c,d \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$, then
        one of the following four cases happens,

        \begin{casesp}
            \item $z$ is odd and $c$ is odd
            
            $z$ is odd IFF one and only one of the summands is even and the other is odd.
            In this case, $d$ is even if one of $a,b,c$ is even.

            \item $z$ is even and $c$ is even
            
            For $z$ to be even, there are two sub-cases,

            \begin{casesp}
                \item Both $a$ and $b$ are evens
                
                $d$ is even if all of $a,b,c$ are even.
                \item Both $a$ and $b$ are odds
                
                $d$ is even if one and only one of $a,b,c$ is even.
            \end{casesp}

            \item $z$ is even and $c$ is odd
            
            $d$ is odd in this case.

            \item $z$ is odd and $c$ is even
            
            $d$ is also odd in this case.
        \end{casesp}

        We conclude that $d$ is even IFF either one and only one of $a,b,c$
        is even or all $a,b,c$ are evens.

        \item We shall first prove a lemma,
        
        \begin{lemPr}
            If $x$ is even, $x^2$ is a multiple of $4$.
            If $x$ is odd, $x^2$ is one more than a multiple of $4$.
        \end{lemPr}
        \begin{proof}
            If $x$ is even, $x = 2k$ for some integer $k$, then $x^2 = 4k^2$.
            If $x$ is odd, $x = 2m + 1$ for some integer $m$, then $x^2 = 4(m^2 + m) + 1$.
        \end{proof}

        Suppose,
        \begin{equation*}
            w^2 + x^2 + y^2 = z^2
        \end{equation*}
        for all $w,x,y,z \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$.
        We shall prove the statement,
        \begin{theoPr}
            $z$ is even IFF all $w,x,y$ are even.
        \end{theoPr}
        \begin{proof}
            We shall prove by case analysis. Assume if $w,x,y$ are even, then
            $w = 2i, x = 2j, y = 2k$ for some integer $i, j, k$; if $w,x,y$
            are odd, then $w = 2m + 1, x = 2n + 1, y = 2l + 1$ for some integer
            $m, n, l$. Then one of the following four cases happen,

            \begin{casesp}
                \item All $w,x,y$ are odd
                \begin{IEEEeqnarray*}{rCl}
                    z^2 & = & (2m + 1)^2 + (2n + 1)^2 + (2l + 1)^2 \\
                    & = & 4(m^2 + n^2 + l^2 + m + n + l) + 3
                \end{IEEEeqnarray*}

                \item One of $w,x,y$ is even
                \begin{IEEEeqnarray*}{rCl}
                    z^2 & = & (2i)^2 + (2n + 1)^2 + (2l + 1)^2 \\
                        & = & 4(i^2 + n^2 + l^2 + n + l) + 2
                \end{IEEEeqnarray*}

                \item Two of $w,x,y$ are even
                \begin{IEEEeqnarray*}{rCl}
                    z^2 & = & (2i)^2 + (2j)^2 + (2l + 1)^2 \\
                        & = & 4(i^2 + j^2 + l^2 + l) + 1
                \end{IEEEeqnarray*}

                \item All of $w,x,y$ are even
                \begin{IEEEeqnarray*}{rCl}
                    z^2 & = & (2i)^2 + (2j)^2 + (2k)^2 \\
                        & = & 4(i^2 + j^2 + k^2)
                \end{IEEEeqnarray*}
            \end{casesp}

            Therefore, if either one and only one of $w,x,y$ is even or all of $w,x,y$
            are even, then $z^2$ is even, which implies $z$ is even. Conversely,
            if $z$ is even, by the above lemma, $z^2$ does not exist in Case 2.
            We conclude that $z$ is even IFF all of $w,x,y$ are even.

    We want to prove the theorem,
    \begin{theoPr}
        There exists an irrational number $a$ such that $a^{\sqrt{3}}$ is rational.
    \end{theoPr}
    \begin{proof}
        We prove by case analysis. The number $x = \sqrt[3]{2}^{\sqrt{3}}$ must be one of
        the two cases,
        \begin{casesp}
            \item $x$ is rational.
            
            In this case, $a = \sqrt[3]{2}$ and $a$ is irrational.

            \item $x$ is irrational.
            
            Let $a = \sqrt[3]{2}^{\sqrt{3}}$. Then $a$ is irrational such that,

            \begin{IEEEeqnarray*}{rCl}
                a^{\sqrt{3}} & = & (\sqrt[3]{2})^{(\sqrt{3})^2} \\

                             & = & 2 
            \end{IEEEeqnarray*}
        \end{casesp}

        We conclude that there exists an irrational $a$ such that $a^{\sqrt{3}}$
        is rational.
    \end{proof}
\end{pr}

\begin{pr}
    The proof is by contradiction. Suppose $a$ is odd, then $a = 2k + 1$ for some
    integer $k$, then for all $n > 0$,
    \begin{equation*}
        a^n = (2k + 1)^n = \sum_{i=1}^n \text{C}^n_i (2k)^i + 1 
        = 2\left(\sum_{i=1}^n \text{C}^n_i 2^{i - 1}k^i\right) + 1
    \end{equation*}

    Therefore, $a^n$ is odd, a contradiction. We conclude that if $a^n$ is even,
    $a$ is even.
\end{pr}

\begin{pr}
    Assume by contradiction that both $a$ and $b$ $> \sqrt{n}$. Then, since $a, b \geq 0$,
    \begin{equation*}

        then either $n^2 = 3(3l^2 + 2l) + 1$ or $n^2 = 3(3l^2 + 2l + 1) + 1$,
        contradicting the antecedent $n^2$ is a multiple of $3$. Therefore,
        $n$ must be a multiple of $3$.

\begin{pr}
    Let $n = 4$ and $m = 8$. Then $16 = 4^2$ is a multiple of $8$, but $4$ is not
    a multiple of $8$. If $m < n$, $n = mk + l$ for some integer $k$ and $l < m$, and
    we will prove that if $n^2$ is a multiple of $m$, then $n$ is a multiple of $m$.
    \begin{proof}
        We will prove by contradiction. Suppose $n = mk + l$ for some positive integer $k$
        and $m < n$ and $l < m$, then $n^2 = m(mk^2 + 2kl) + l^2 < 2m(mk^2 + 2kl)$.
        Therefore, $n^2$ is not a multiple of $m$, a contradiction.
