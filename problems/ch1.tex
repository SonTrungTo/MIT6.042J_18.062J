        The middle square is a square of $(b-a) \times (b-a)$

        \item \label{1.b.sec1} $[$\note{Possible Errata:} Arrange the same shapes so they form
        two rectangles, both $a \times b$.$]$

        \begin{tikzpicture}
            \begin{scope}
                \draw[fill=green!70] (0,0) -- ++(0,-4) -- ++(1.3,0) -- cycle;
                \draw[fill=yellow!70] (0,0) -- ++(1.3,0) -- ++(0,-4) -- cycle;

        We prove by construct a chain of iffs.
        \begin{IEEEeqnarray*}{C'rCl}
            & (b - a)^2 & = & c^2 - 2ab \\
            \Leftrightarrow & a^2 + b^2 - 2ab & = & c^2 - 2ab \\
            \Leftrightarrow & a^2 + b^2 & = & c^2 \\
        \end{IEEEeqnarray*}

        \item The equation would still hold true since $a = b$ is not
        a requirement for the proof. In fact, note that if $a = b$,
        the area of the bigger square in \ref{1.a.sec1} will now be
        exactly equal to the sum of area of all triangles inside it,
        which is equal to the sum of area of two smaller squares in \ref{1.b.sec1}.
        That is, $c^2 = a^2 + b^2$.

        \item Some assumptions about right triangles, squares and lines are,
        \begin{itemize}
            \item 4 identical right triangles.
            \item For every 2 points, there is a line.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{pr}

    \begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{(\alph*)}]
        \item Mistake:
        \begin{equation*}
            \sqrt{(-1)(-1)} = \sqrt{-1}\sqrt{-1}
        \end{equation*}
        The right-hand side of this equation is undefined while the left-hand side
        is defined.
        \item Suppose $1 = -1$, then
        \begin{IEEEeqnarray*}{C'rCl}
                        & 0     & = & 0 \\
            \Rightarrow & 1^2 - 1^2 & = & 1 + 1 \\
            \Rightarrow & (1 - 1)(1 + 1) & = & 1 + 1
        \end{IEEEeqnarray*}
        At this stage, we cancel off $1 + 1$ on each side since they are non-zero, the equation
        then becomes,
        \begin{IEEEeqnarray*}{C'rCl}
            \Rightarrow & 1 - 1 & = & 1 \\
            \Rightarrow & 1 + 1 & = & 1 \\
            \Rightarrow & 2 & = & 1
        \end{IEEEeqnarray*}
        where the second equation is by the antecedent $1 = -1$. Hence, we have
        proved $2 = 1$.
        \item We shall prove the following lemma,
        \begin{lemPr}
            If $r,s > 0$, then $\sqrt{rs} = \sqrt{r}\sqrt{s}$
        \end{lemPr}
        \begin{proof}
            Assume $r,s > 0$. For every positive integer $x$, there is one $\sqrt{x} > 0$
            such that $x = (\sqrt{x})^2$; therefore,
            \begin{equation}
                (\sqrt{r})^2(\sqrt{s})^2 = rs
            \end{equation}
            By commutative and associative property of multiplication, 
            \begin{equation}
                (\sqrt{r})^2(\sqrt{s})^2 = (\sqrt{r}\sqrt{s})^2
            \end{equation}
            which leads to
            \begin{equation}
                (\sqrt{r}\sqrt{s})^2 = rs
            \end{equation}
            Since $rs > 0$, there is also one $\sqrt{rs} > 0$ such that
            $(\sqrt{rs})^2 = rs$. Therefore,
            \begin{equation}
                (\sqrt{r}\sqrt{s})^2 = (\sqrt{rs})^2
            \end{equation}
            Since $\sqrt{r}\sqrt{s} > 0$ and $\sqrt{rs} > 0$,
            we conclude
            \begin{equation}
                \sqrt{r}\sqrt{s} = \sqrt{rs}
            \end{equation}
        \end{proof}
    \end{enumerate}

    \begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{(\alph*)}]
        \item Mistake,
        \begin{IEEEeqnarray*}{rCl}
            3                & > & 2 \\
            3\log_{10} (1/2) & > & 2\log_{10} (1/2)
        \end{IEEEeqnarray*}
        since $\log_{10} n \;\forall  0 < n < 1$ is always negative.
        \item Wrong because all arithmetic operations must be done
        on numbers with the same currency, so that they will be in the
        same field.
        \item Since $a = b$, $a - b = 0$, and therefore we cannot
        cancel $a - b$ on both sides since we cannot divide each side by $0$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{pr}

\begin{pr}
    The questionable step is from step 2 to step 3, namely,
    \begin{IEEEeqnarray*}{rCl}
        a + b & \overset{?}{\geq} & 2\sqrt{ab}Â \\
        a^2 + 2ab + b^2 & \overset{?}{\geq} & 4ab
    \end{IEEEeqnarray*}

    Assume that $a, b < 0$. Then even though the first inequality
    is false, the second inequality is true, which will lead to all
    subsequent inequalities to be true. Therefore, we have just ``proved''
    that arithmetic mean is at least as large as geometric mean for
    all negative numbers $a, b$!

    To fix this,
    \begin{IEEEeqnarray*}{rCl}
        \dfrac{a + b}{2} & \geq & \sqrt{ab} \\
        a + b - 2\sqrt{ab} & \geq & 0 \\
        (\sqrt{a} - \sqrt{b})^2 & \geq & 0 \\
    \end{IEEEeqnarray*}

    This ensures that $a, b \geq 0$ so that the last inequality
    can be defined.

    The reasoning is wrong because of the implicit assumption
    on Monday.

    \begin{assPr} \label{assPr:1.5:sec1}
        If Albert didn't give the quiz \boldText{before} Monday,
        by Midnight Sunday, we know the quiz has to be on Monday.
    \end{assPr}

    The contrapositive of this statement is,

    \begin{assPr}[equivalent to \ref{assPr:1.5:sec1}]
        If the quiz is not on Monday, then Albert gave the quiz
        \boldText{before} Monday.
    \end{assPr}

    This is a false assumption since we know Albert gives out
    his quiz on next week. This collapses the chain of arguments
    and therefore the reasoning is false.

    We prove by case analysis. Let $x = \log_{7} n \;\forall n \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$
    so that $7^x = n$.
    We argue that there are two scenarios,
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $x$ is an integer
        \item $x$ is a non-integer
    \end{enumerate}
    These cases are clearly exhaustive.
    \begin{casesp}
        \item $x$ is an integer
        
        We use a certain fact called the fundamental theorem of algebra,

        \begin{factPr}
            All positive integers are products of unique primes.
        \end{factPr}

        Therefore, for all $n$ that are a factor of $7$ (e.g, 7, 49, 343, \ldots),
        $x$ is an integer.
        
        \item $x$ is a non-integer
        
        We prove by contradiction. Assume $x$ is rational, then $x = \dfrac{p}{q}$
        for all integers $p,q \in \mathbb{Z}^{+}$ that do not share common factor such that $7^{\frac{p}{q}} = n$.
        Then $n^q = 7^p$, which means that $n^q$ is divisible by 7. We know a fact,

        \begin{factPr}
            If $n^q$ is divisible by 7, then $n$ is also divisible by 7.
        \end{factPr}

        This fact is easily proved by contradiction. But then $n = 7k$ for some
        positive integer $k$, which means that $k^q = 7^{p - q}$. W.l.o.g,
        suppose $p > q$, we can reapply the above fact until $q$ is large enough
        so that eventually the left-hand side is a product of some positive integer $k$ while
        the right-hand side is $7^s$ such that $s \in \mathbb{Z}^{-}$, which
        is a rational number, which is false. Therefore, we conclude that
        $x$ is an irrational number.
    \end{casesp}
