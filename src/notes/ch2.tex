\chapter{The Well Ordering Principle (WOP)}

\begin{center}
    \emph{Every nonempty set of nonnegative integers has a smallest element.}
\end{center}

\begin{claim}
    $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational implies the well ordering principle has been assumed.
\end{claim}

\begin{proof}
    Assume by contradiction that $\sqrt{2} = \dfrac{m}{n}$ where it cannot be rewritten
    in the lowest common denominator. Let $\ms{C}$ be the set of all numerators of such fractions.
    By assumption, $\ms{C}$ is non-empty as $m \in \ms{C}$. By WOP, there exists a smallest element
    $m_{0}$. By definition of $\ms{C}$, there exists $n_{0} > 0, n \in \ms{Z}$ such that
    \begin{equation*}
        \dfrac{m_0}{n_0} \in \ms{C}
    \end{equation*}
    By definition of $\ms{C}$, there must be an integer $k > 1$ such that
    \begin{equation*}
        \dfrac{\dfrac{m_0}{k}}{\dfrac{n_0}{k}} = \dfrac{m_0}{n_0}
    \end{equation*}
    Therefore, $\dfrac{m_0}{k} \in \ms{C}$. But then $\dfrac{m_0}{k} < m_0$, contradicting
    that $m_0$ is the smallest element in $\ms{C}$. Therefore, $\ms{C} = \emptyset$, meaning
    there is no fractions that cannot be written in the lowest common denominator.
\end{proof}

\begin{claim}
    \begin{equation}
        \sum_{1}^{n} i = n(n+1)/2
    \end{equation}
\end{claim}

\begin{proof}
    The proof is by contradiction.
\end{proof}
